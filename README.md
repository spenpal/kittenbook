Project Based On Book "Learning To Program" By Steven Foote

> *"You will be programming a complete Chrome extension. The extension we will be building together will ask a user for a name and phone number, then change all the images in the user's Facebook newsfeed to kittens or puppies, based on the user's location (as determined by the phone number). This extension (which we call kittenbook) might not be particularly useful, but it will be fun to build, and it will help you learn a lot of important programming concepts along the way"*
